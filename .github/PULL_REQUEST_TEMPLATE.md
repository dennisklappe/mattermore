## What changed

<!-- One or two sentences. If this adds a patch, name the file. -->

## Why

<!-- The problem it solves, or the issue it closes. -->

## How it was tested

<!-- Server version, deployment type, and what you actually ran. "Built and
uploaded to a Docker Compose server on Mattermost 10.5.1, started a four
person call" beats "works fine". -->

## Checklist

- [ ] Patches are small and independent, one feature per patch file. Large patches conflict on the next upstream release and slow down security fixes.
- [ ] Nothing under `server/enterprise/` or any `LICENSE.enterprise` path is modified.
- [ ] Docs are updated if behaviour changed.
- [ ] `site/` build was re-run if anything under `site/src/content` changed.
